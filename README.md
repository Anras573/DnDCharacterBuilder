# DnDCharacterBuilder

This project is a work in progress character builder for Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition, with a specific focus on implementing the College of Eloquence Bard's "Silver Tongue" feature. This feature allows you to treat any roll of 9 or lower on a d20 as a 10.

## Key Features

Create character profiles with basic information (name, class, level, etc.)
Roll dice, including support for the d20 with "Silver Tongue" modification.

## How to Use

* Clone this repository.
* Run the program (specific instructions will depend on your development environment and chosen programming language).
* Enter character information as prompted.
* Use the dice rolling feature, which will automatically apply the "Silver Tongue" modifier for College of Eloquence Bards.

> Note: This is a work in progress, and additional features and functionalities are planned.
